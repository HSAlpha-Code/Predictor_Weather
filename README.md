You need to configure your config.py for this code to work. Go to weatherapi.com make an account and plug in the api key into this file. 

Some parts of this code isn't mine which is mentioned in comments in file predict.py. I will be making changes to make it 3 APIs for more consistency soon(tm) to make it 100% mine as I learn more concepts.

**Note:** You must have python downloaded & installed on your system and I highly recommend lauching this file through your terminal.
